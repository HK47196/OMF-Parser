Parser/dumper for the Relocatable Object Module Format(OMF) format based upon
the TIS Specification v1.1. The intent is to be an entirely standards compliant parser as per the TIS spec.

Should support all mentioned extensions and obsolete features.

TODO:

- May eventually support the OS/2 OMF Specification.

- Need to review Microsoft's specifications to see what, if any, extensions they
  made.

- Need a large test corpus
